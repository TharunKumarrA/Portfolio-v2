        "Our project, Mediclined, was developed for the Healthcare track at Evolumin National Level Hackathon 2024, aiming to transform healthcare services within a university setting. It integrates features like real-time doctor tracking, an online pharmacy, and secure medical records to enhance health outcomes for students. Built in just 36 hours, Mediclined evolved through critical feedback during two intense judging rounds, pushing us to refine and deliver a polished prototype. Though we didnâ€™t win, making it to the Top 10 among numerous talented teams was a proud moment, showcasing our dedication, teamwork, and innovation.",
