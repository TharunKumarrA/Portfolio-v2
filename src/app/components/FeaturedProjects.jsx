        "Co-developed SustAIn, a browser extension that displays real-time carbon emissions and power consumption metrics for AI web platforms. Used by 25+ users and submitted to the GDG On-Campus Solutions Challenge 2025. The system uses a lightweight ML model trained with Google AutoML on Vertex AI to classify user queries and estimate their environmental impact. The frontend is optimized for performance and resiliency with retry, fallback, and timeout logicâ€”cutting latency spikes by 40%.",
