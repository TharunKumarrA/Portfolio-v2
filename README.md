# Tharun's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases my skills in both UI/UX design and full-stack development. It serves as a reflection of my dedication to creating intuitive and visually appealing user experiences.

The design process for this site was a labor of love, taking me two months to perfect. During this time, I went through several iterations, drawing inspiration from various sources, and refining my vision. In contrast, the coding aspect of the site took just 3 days to bring everything to life.

This portfolio is not only a display of my work but also a demonstration of my creative problem-solving abilities and my passion for blending design with functionality.
